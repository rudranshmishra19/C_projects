This project simulates the behavior of an electric fan by controlling its speed and direction. The program can be used to demonstrate concepts like user input, conditional statements, and basic control mechanisms.
Control the fan speed (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
Change the rotation direction (e.g., Clockwise or Counterclockwise).
Display the current state of the fan (Speed and Direction).
Reset the fan to default settings.
